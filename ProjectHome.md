Xinha is a powerful WYSIWYG HTML editor component, which works in Mozilla / Firefox based browsers as well as in MS IE. Its configurabilty and extensibility make it easy to build just the right editor for multiple purposes, from a restricted mini-editor for one database field to a full-fledged website editor. Its liberal licence makes it an ideal candidate for integration into any kind of project, such as Joomla!

This Joomla! plugin is based on Xinha 0.95 stable
